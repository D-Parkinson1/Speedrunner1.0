# Speedrunner--- A Phaser-Game
==================================
Speedrunner is a game I made for a school assignment. It was made using the Phaser library.

It is a platforming game that incorporates many coming platforming mechanics such as double jumps, variable jump height, different movement speeds and a variety of enemies.

I am very happy with how the game turned out.
